# Analog-Function-Generator

* Function generators are commonly used to generate analog waveforms (like sine waves, square waves, sawtooth waves etc.) in a variety of applications, such as sweep generation, AM/FM generation and Phase Locked Loops (PLLs). 
* Some of the popular analog ICs used in the past were MAX038, XR2206 and NTE864. Now they have been mostly replaced with chips using Direct Digital Synthesis (AD9850 DDS signal generator module). 
* Function generators can usually change their waveform frequency precisely among a wide range of values (0.1 Hz to 1 MHz). Furthermore, they can even change their amplitudes and average DC values. In some sensitive applications, capability of a function generator to create a clean, noise-free waveform becomes 
extremely important. 
* This repo is about an analog circuit using transistors and op-amps which can generate sine waves, square waves (with variable duty cycle), sawtooth waves and triangular waves.
